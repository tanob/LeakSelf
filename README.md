LeakSelf
========

I've created this educational project to show how an iOS app implemented with Swift
handles memory allocation and deallocation and more specifically how using `weak` and
`unowned` can help control that.

Some other resources useful to understand Swift's ARC:
* [Swift guide on Automatic Reference Counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html)
* [Stop wild weakification](http://codedby.pm/stop-wild-weakification/)
* ["Weak, Strong, Unowned, Oh My!" - A Guide to References in Swift](https://krakendev.io/blog/weak-and-unowned-references-in-swift)
